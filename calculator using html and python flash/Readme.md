# SDOF Free and forced vibration calculator
SDOF Free and forced vibration calculator Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) Vibration Calculator to calculate mass-spring-damper  natural frequency, circular frequency, time period of oscillation, damping factor, Q factor,  critical damping, damped natural frequency, damped natural angular frequency and 
transmissibility (if forced vibration) for a harmonic input.

Process of programming:

• All coding is done in python and HTML is embedded inside python code only.

• I have used python flash. Flask focus on what the users are requesting and what sort of response to give back. The code lets us run a basic web application that we can serve, as if it were a website.

• The libraries required to run this program are flask, NumPy, math, matplotlib

• Important: The code has to run in the same host where the link is tested as flash here has not gone into any other website. It is in development. So the link(http://127.0.0.1:5000/) gets activated only if the code is run in the host computer with the required libraries.

• The code of this program(c.py) and the video file (SDOF CAL.mp4) is uploaded.

• The pdfs of all the pages is uploaded
