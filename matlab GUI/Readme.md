# fixed fixed beam calculator

A system is said to be a Fixed-Fixed beam system if it has a fixed connection at both its ends.
Vibration analysis of a fixed-fixed beam system is important as it can explain and help us analyze a number of 
real-life systems.
The project Free vibration of Beam as SDOF System CALCULATOR where the Boundary conditions is given as 
Fixed-Fixed beam. We have made use of the different concepts and formulae which have been taught to us 
during the coursework. Our project has involved the creation of the calculator with the help of MATLAB and 
has included various different features which have been mentioned in the report to provide with the required 
output from the given input from the user, also plot a Amplitude versus Time graph of the simulated system 
and also create an accurate animation of the system.
