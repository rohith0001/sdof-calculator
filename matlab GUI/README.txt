Instructions to run the code:


1.Once you have unzipped the contents, you first have to go the 28_M2_Question7_Calculatorapp folder, where you will find the 28_M2_Question7_CalculatorApp.mlapp file and load it on MATLAB.
2. Once you have opened the app now you first need to choose the "Material".
3. After you choose the material you can enter the System properties with the appropriate units.
4. Select the desired cross section by selecting the tab.
5. Input the dimensions.
6. Press calculate and the results will be displayed.
