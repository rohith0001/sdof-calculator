# Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) Vibration Calculator
Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) Vibration Calculator to calculate mass-spring-damper 
natural frequency, circular frequency, time period of oscillation, damping factor, Q factor, 
critical damping, damped natural frequency, damped natural angular frequency and 
transmissibility (if forced vibration) for a harmonic input

Process of programming:

• All coding is done in python language

• I have used python tkinter. Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the 
standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard 
GUI.

• The libraries required to run this program are tkinter, NumPy, math, matplotlib

• The code of this program(calc.py) and the video file (SDOF CAL GUI.mp4) is 
uploaded.

• The pdfs of all the pages is uploaded
